Multithread accessible database with big int data limit

Multithread ideas:

access method
with access sorting with allowance of only read or only write method to run parallel
 
 access method with state id that determines which methods can run
 
 1 - get and add method
 2 - set and add method
 3 - insert and add method
 4 - remove and add method
 
 method queue build up limit to make sure a single id doesn't stick for too long holding up the other method calls
 
 idea two:
 
 dynamic thread creation for easy creation of running multiple methods in parallel
 
 look into weird stuff for this
